# Manta Deployment

This repository contains the manta deployment tools.  These tools use SAPI (see
http://github.com/TritonDataCenter/sdc-sapi) to deploy and configure the manta
object storage service.  This document assumes familiarity with the SAPI object
model, so go read the SAPI docs if you haven't already.

## Deploying Manta

The Manta deployment documentation has moved to
[manta](http://github.com/TritonDataCenter/manta).

        title: Global zone log files not uploaded
        description: Some global zone log files have not been uploaded
        severity: minor
        response: >-
            The system automatically retries hourly to upload any internal log
            files that have not yet been uploaded.
        impact: >-
            There is no impact to end-user service.  However, failure to upload
            files is often indicative of problems affecting end user requests.
        action: >-
            Identify the reason for the failure and resolve the underlying
            issue.

            In most components, the log "/var/log/mbackup.log" has a record of
            recent upload attempts and results.  Another common cause of log
            upload failure is when a component or service was offline during the
            scheduled log upload time.

        title: Global zone SMF services in maintenance
        description: One or more global zone SMF services are in maintenance
        severity: major
        response: No automated response will be taken.
        impact: >-
            The impact depends on which services are in maintenance.  In some
            cases, overall request handling capacity may be reduced.  If enough
            instances are in maintenance, end users could experience errors.
        action: >-
            In the affected global zones, use "svcs -xv" to identify the
            services in maintenance and see basic instructions for tracking down
            the problem.

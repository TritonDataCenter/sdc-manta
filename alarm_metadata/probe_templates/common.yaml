    # The CPU utilization probe notifies operators when any server is at high
    # overall CPU utilization for an extended period of time (currently 23
    # per-minute samples within 30 minutes).  This might be indicative of
    # degraded service, though it doesn't react quickly enough to usefully
    # identify that.  It's conceivably useful for capacity planning, but that
    # would likely be better accomplished using a metric collection system that
    # keeps historical data.
    #
    # Also of note: this probe is deliberately per-zone rather than per-CN.
    # That helps identify which components are affected by heavy CPU
    # utilization.

        impact: Service provided by affected components may be degraded.
        action: >-
            Identify the source of excessive CPU utilization and resolve the
            issue.  If components are behaving normally, consider adding
            additional capacity using new servers.

        response: No automated response will be taken.
        impact: >-
            There is no immediate impact, but if the filesystem fills up,
            service may become severely degraded.  End user requests may
            experience high error rates or increased latency.
        action: >-
            Identify the cause of excessive disk usage and resolve the
            underlying issue.

        response: No automated response will be taken.
        impact: >-
            If the problem was transient, there may be no impact.  Otherwise, a
            component may no longer be registered for internal service
            discovery.  Capacity may be affected, resulting in increased latency
            or error rates for end user requests.  If enough instances
            experience this issue, a major service disruption could result.
        action: >-
            Determine the scope of the problem based on the log message and
            resolve the underlying issue.

        title: Log files not uploaded
        description: Some log files have not been uploaded
        severity: minor
        response: >-
            The system automatically retries hourly to upload any internal log
            files that have not yet been uploaded.
        impact: >-
            There is no impact to end-user service.  However, failure to upload
            files is often indicative of problems affecting end user requests.

            If the affected logs are used for metering, then metering reports
            and access logs for end users may be unavailable or incomplete until
            the affected logs are uploaded and the relevant metering jobs re-run
            by an operator.
        action: >-
            Identify the reason for the failure and resolve the underlying
            issue.  If logs used for metering were affected, you may need to
            re-run the relevant metering jobs once all logs are available.

            In most components, the log "/var/log/mbackup.log" has a record of
            recent upload attempts and results.  Another common cause of log
            upload failure is when a component or service was offline during the
            scheduled log upload time.

        description: One or more SMF services are in maintenance
        severity: major
        response: No automated response will be taken.
        impact: >-
            The impact depends on which services are in maintenance.  In some
            cases, overall request handling capacity may be reduced.  If enough
            instances are in maintenance, end users could experience errors.
        action: >-
            In the affected zones, use "svcs -xv" to identify the services in
            maintenance and to see basic instructions for tracking down the
            problem.

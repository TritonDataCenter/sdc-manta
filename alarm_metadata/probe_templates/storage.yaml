            Depending on the number of affected storage nodes, the system may
            have reduced ability to survive additional failures.  If enough
            storage nodes are affected, the system may not be able to continue
            accepting writes.

    # The point of this probe is to identify when storage nodes go down.  For
    # that to be useful, we need to run the check from somewhere else.  We
    # select the "nameservice" zone, on the grounds that there should be at
    # least one per datacenter, and not a whole lot more than that.  It would be
    # better if Amon supported opening alarms when expected checks did not
    # complete successfully.

            If the storage node is down, then Manta will direct writes to other
            storage nodes.  Reads for objects with a copy on the affected
            storage node will be directed to other storage nodes that also have
            a copy of the object, when possible.
        impact: >-
            If the storage node is down, then reads will fail when they operate
            on objects having only one copy that happens to be stored on the
            affected node.

        severity: critical
        response: No automated response will be taken.
        impact: >-
            If the filesystem exceeds 90% utilization, Manta will stop using the
            affected storage instance.  This can result in imbalanced storage
            allocation across the fleet.  If enough servers are affected by this
            issue, Manta may become unavailable for new writes.
        action: >-
            Identify the cause of excessive disk usage and resolve the
            underlying issue.

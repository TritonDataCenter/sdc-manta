# Makefile: basic Makefile to build deployment image
#
# This Makefile should contain only repo-specific logic and uses included
# makefiles to supply common targets (javascriptlint, jsstyle, restdown, etc.),
# which are used by other repos as well.
#
# If you find yourself adding support for new targets that could be useful for
# other projects too, you should add these to the original versions of the
# included Makefiles (in eng.git) so that other teams can use them too.
